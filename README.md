# kMeansClustering
Python and Java files relating to a cluster generator and employing the K-Means Clustering algorithm to re-cluster data.

The cluster.py file contains every class and uses Matplotlib to plot the data.
It also uses the Principle Component Analysis algorithm where n-dimensional data is reduced to the desired number of dimensions.
In this case, it is reduced to 3 typically so that higher dimensional data can be plotted and seen visually.
